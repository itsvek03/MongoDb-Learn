a) What is mongodb ?

Ans) MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently. 
It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables. 

    database -> Collection(Tables) -> document(data)

The documents are created using the fields. Fields are key-value pairs in the documents, it is just like columns in the relation database.
The value of the fields can be of any BSON data types like double, string, boolean, etc.
The data stored in the MongoDB is in the format of BSON documents. 
Here, BSON stands for Binary representation of JSON documents. Or in other words, in the backend, 
the MongoDB server converts the JSON data into a binary form that is known as BSON and this BSON is stored and queried more efficiently.


{
    "name":"Sutra Hub",
    "age":29,
    "address":{
        "city":"Kanpur"
    },
    "hobbies":[
        {"name":"Reading"},
        {"name":"Sports"},
    ]
}


Advantage of MongoDB:->

a) It is a schema-less NoSQL database. You need not to design the schema of the database when you are working with MongoDB.
b) It does not support join operation.
c) It provides great flexibility to the fields in the documents.
d) It is a document oriented database and the data is stored in BSON documents.
e) It does not require any SQL injection.

Disadvantage of MongoDB :->
a) It uses high memory for data storage.
b) You are not allowed to store more than 16MB data in the documents.
c) The nesting of data in BSON is also limited you are not allowed to nest data more than 100 levels.

b) Difference between NoSQL and SQL ?

NOSQL -> Stores data like documents,key-value pairs, wide-columns and graphs
SQL -> Store data into tables with fixed rows and columns

NoSQL  -> Stored unstructured data
SQL   -> Stored structured data

NOSQL -> Schema is flexible
SQL  -> Schema is rigid

NoSQL  -> Does not support joins
SQL   -> Supports joins

NoSQL  -> follows CAP Theorem
SQL    -> follows ACID property
